    <h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
    <h2>Health & Fitness</h2>
    <p>I first became interested in health & fitness during my time at university where I started to use and learn about the gym.</p>
    <p>After helping my friends to get started and get results I loved that feeling so much that I became a personal trainer.</p>
    <p>Since then I've trained in and explored various different kinds of exercise from calisthenics to skateboarding to parkour.</p>

    <h2>Music & Performing</h2>
    <p>I've played guitar since I was 8 years old, started to teach myself piano at 25 and I've sung for as long as I can remember.</p>
    <p>When I was 27 I joined a local theatre group, performed in musicals and the following year performed as Robin Hood at the Epstein Theatre in a musical based in Sherwood Forest.</p>
    <p>I've done verious shows since and currently sing in care homes for the elderly and at parties and weddings with my band <a href="https://www.instagram.com/squareparkduo">Square Park</a>.</p>
